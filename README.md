# MachineLearningPractice

### Raison D'être
Primarily a repo for increasing familiarity with machine learning across the different categories. I'm hoping to apply what I learn here at work, to refine our scoring and improve chances of successful outcomes.

### TransferLearningTF
This is Microsoft's tutorial found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/image-classification).


### TaxiFarePrediction
This is Microsoft's tutorial found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/predict-prices).

### BinaryClassification
My attempt at a binary classification that allows for variable feature length. I think eventually I'll want to read columns from a report into a model. This, I think, is a proof of concept.

Adapted from Microsoft's code [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/docs/samples/Microsoft.ML.Samples/Dynamic/Trainers/BinaryClassification/LbfgsLogisticRegression.cs).
Using custom schema solution, to get around having to predefine dataset width, provided by Raitpngman in the answers on this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63930046/ml-net-schema-mismatch-expected-varvectorbyte-got-vectorbyte).

### W3PythonMachineLearning
Following along with the machine learning tutorial, getting reacquainted with Python, and learning to use Visual Studio with Python.

This is a collection of Python machine learning code from the W3Schools [Machine Learning Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_getting_started.asp).
